<h2>Securing Wireless Networks</h2>

<b>Wireless networking has become present everywhere and is synonymous with being online. Most places with an internet connection have a wireless modem or router serving a multitude of devices, from desktops to phones and internet of things (IoT) devices such as TVs, light bulbs, and refrigerators. Without the use of wireless technology, life today would be less convenient. However, with the increase of wireless technology, we've been forced to give up some of our online security. </b>

<b>As wireless technologies evolve, the effective distance of our wireless network improves, so much that we're seeing larger networks that overflow from what used to be local area networks (LANs) inside our premises, all the way to our neighbors. This is amazing when it comes to connectivity, however for security, this is disastrous.  </b>
